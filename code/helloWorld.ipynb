      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    The ``mlflow`` module provides a high-level \"fluent\" API for starting and managing MLflow runs.\n",
      "    For example:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    .. code:: python\n",
      "    \n",
      "        import mlflow\n",
      "    \n",
      "        mlflow.start_run()\n",
      "        mlflow.log_param(\"my\", \"param\")\n",
      "        mlflow.log_metric(\"score\", 100)\n",
      "        mlflow.end_run()\n",
      "    \n",
      "    You can also use the context manager syntax like this:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    .. code:: python\n",
      "    \n",
      "        with mlflow.start_run() as run:\n",
      "            mlflow.log_param(\"my\", \"param\")\n",
      "            mlflow.log_metric(\"score\", 100)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    which automatically terminates the run at the end of the ``with`` block.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The fluent tracking API is not currently threadsafe. Any concurrent callers to the tracking API must\n",
      "    implement mutual exclusion manually.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    For a lower level API, see the :py:mod:`mlflow.tracking` module.\n",
